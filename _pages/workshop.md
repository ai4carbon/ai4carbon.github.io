Hour 2: Discussion Session

We will discuss current challenges in atmospheric tracer transport modeling and inversion, and explore how recent advances in AI/ML can facilitate carbon cycle research, including transport model development, data assimilation, and uncertainty quantification.
NOTE: We invite all participants to share their perspectives on transport models and inversion methods through a brief pre-workshop survey. Your valuable insights will help guide our discussion and highlight critical areas for development in the field.
